SIMPLE SEARCH ENGINE

Objective:
Search engine will able to provide users required information at one particular place by using
the words and patterns entered by the user during their search operation. All the information
will be provided over the browser screen where users can select appropriate link filtered by the
search query. Whatever the information presented to the user can be in any form by default
such as it may be in the form of web pages, pdf file, doc file etc. The search query will provide
listing of web pages as per their occurrence during search operations.

This search mechanism will work on
the concept of tags and meta tags which are used while writing the contents under the
particular web pages. If the user’s query don’t matched with the tags and meta tags then it will
go for summary section to match the given words in order to present the exact output or
results. Upon going through web pages an index file will be created where listing of pages will
be done by the system and present them as per their index number. Keyword density for a
particular post under a particular web page will also help the system to set the priority for
indexing the web page.
Existing System:
The previous search engine was not able to work under real time situation and able to fetch
information which are only saved under their database. So there was no mechanism for
building the index file and keeping information as per the user search query. Most of time,
users were not able to get their desired information and this section keeping users at their
limit. Users were only able to get information in the form of web page which are linked to
others. Existing system was not able to handle and store files and information using proper
keywords and tags in the form of pdf, doc or in the format of zip file.
Proposed System:
Some special mechanism has been used to work on the concept of web crawling which can be
integrated with this search engine. As to work under real time situation, it will enable the
system, to go through the various web pages by using the keyword and prepare the list of it
based on the search pattern. Before accessing the data to the users, it will first encrypt the
index information and saves them to the database for their use.
